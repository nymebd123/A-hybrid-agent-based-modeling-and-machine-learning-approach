# Building Energy Consumption Prediction Project

## What the Project Does
This project focuses on accurately predicting occupant energy consumption in buildings using a hybrid approach that integrates Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), System Dynamics (SD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to enhance energy management and promote sustainability by improving predictions of energy consumption in different indoor layout configurations.

## Why the Project is Useful
Accurately predicting occupant energy consumption is essential for optimizing energy usage in buildings, leading to cost savings and reduced environmental impact. This project's hybrid approach aims to address the challenges associated with gathering reliable stochastic data on energy consumption.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Review the Jupyter Notebook or code files to explore the hybrid modeling approach and machine learning techniques used for energy consumption prediction.
